# N. Design System
- A react component library inspired by the essential anime `Neon Genesis Evangelion`.
- Storybook available at dwwr.github.io
- These idiosyncratic design elements have been recreated in pure, functional React/HTML/CSS.
- Designed to push the boundary of what UX is possible in web 2.0, and challenge accepted design language
- The original stated purpose:
  - Accomplish development of highly complex components that do not follow typical web design principles, standards, or aesthetics
  - Define new design principles, standards, and aesthetics based on the animeâ€™s art direction
  - Improve front end development abilities through tackling massive UX challenges
  - Develop a library of components and organize a storybook
- This repository also includes some WIP components that utilize [Zdog](https://zzz.dog/), [react-zdog](https://github.com/drcmda/react-zdog), and [Zfont](https://jaames.github.io/zfont/).
  - Of special note is a declarative abstraction of Zfont for use in react-zdog apps.
